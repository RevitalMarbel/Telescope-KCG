# Telescope-KCG
This project allows robotic telescopes to have a flexible computer based ability of aiming an tracking fast targets such as ISS, HAB, or drones.
Given a target position (Lat, Lon, Alt) the global algular diff between the telescope and the target is computed. 
These two angles are then transformed to local (telescope) angles.
